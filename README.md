## GraphQL Resources
GraphQL is the query language for PFF FCâ€™s APIs and provides an alternative to REST and ad-hoc webservice architectures. It allows clients to define the structure of the data required, and exactly the same structure of the data is returned from the server. It is a strongly typed runtime which allows clients to dictate what data is needed.
